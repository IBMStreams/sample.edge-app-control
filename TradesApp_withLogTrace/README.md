#### TradesApp_withLogTrace 
This is a simple starter application, meant only for illustration purposes.  It processes pre-canned stock trades from a CSV file.  The application will filter out some of the stocks based on ticker names.  It will then calculate the average, maximum and minimum ask price for each of the stocks.  The results will be written to standard out.

Submission time variables are supported by this application, and there inputted values will be traced to the trace log.
